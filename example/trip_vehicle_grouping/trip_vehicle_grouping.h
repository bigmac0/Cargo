/* The Trip Assignment Problem
 *
 * Citation:
 *
 * Javier Alonso-Mora, Samitha Samaranayake, Alex Wallar, Emilio Frazzoli, and
 * Daniela Rus. "On-demand high-capacity ride-sharing via dynamic trip-vehicle
 * assignment". PNAS 114(3), 2017, pp.462-467.
 *
 * The problem minimizes the cost of assigning vehicles to shared trips, plus a
 * penalty for each unserved customer. Given a set of trips, a cost c_ij gives
 * the detour cost of vehicle i serving trip j; a binary variable x_ij equals 1
 * if the vehicle serves the trip and 0 otherwise. A seperate cost C_k gives
 * the travel cost of customer k (equal to the shortest-path from the
 * customer's origin to destination), and a binary variable y_k equals 1 if the
 * customer is unserved by any trip and 0 otherwise. The objective function is:
 *
 *     min z = sum(c_ij*x_ij)        for all i,j
 *             + sum(C_k*y_k)        for all k
 *
 * The problem is constrained by two sets of equations. The first set retricts
 * vehicles to serve only 1 trip:
 *
 *     Given vehicle i, 0 <= sum over j (x_ij) <= 1 for trips j where vehicle i
 *     can serve j within window constraints
 *
 * The second set restricts customers to be served only once, or not served at
 * all:
 *
 *     Given customer k, y_k + sum over i,j (x_ij) == 1 for vehicle-trip pair
 *     ij where trip j includes customer k
 *
 * Trips are constructed iteratively using the steps in the paper. Briefly,
 * customer pairs are formed based on if the two trips are shareable; then
 * customer-vehicle pairs are formed; then trips of larger sizes (>2) are
 * formed iteratively.
 *
 * In this example, GLPK is used to solve the minimization problem. But the
 * performance of GLPK is quite poor compared with commercial options.

/* Strategy
 *
 * The default RSAlgorithm::listen() method calls match() at every
 * batch_time().  Thus during match(), we will form trips from the unassigned
 * customers and active vehicles, then construct the binary integer linear
 * program to solve the assignment problem, then call glpk to do the actual
 * solving. Vehicles will be updated based on their assignments through calls
 * to RSAlgorithm::commit(). We will use a grid index to help construct the rv
 * pairs when building the rv-graph.
