/* Annealing a metal is the process of repeatedly heating/cooling it
 * in order to get rid of impurities. For Simulated Annealing, we first
 * generate a solution out of the unmatched customers and vehicles; then
 * perturb the solution; depending on the "temperature", we accept perturbed
 * solutions of higher or lower cost than the original solution.
 *
 * Here we use "random reassign" as our perturbation. We generate an initial
 * solution by looping through all customers and assigning to random nearest
 * neighbor; we generate a "perturbed" solution by shuffling the customers,
 * then again assign. */
