\section{Introduction}

This document provides reference for the \code{libcargo} C++11 software
library.  The library is designed to facilitate implementing and evaluating
ridesharing algorithms.  It is first-of-its-kind, and many comfort
features (like error handling) are missing; however the current state is
usable, and several examples can be found online
\footnote{https://github.com/jamjpan/Cargo/tree/master/example}.
