using this system, but we could use some help and expertise! If you would like

# Cargo - Ridesharing Simulation & Algorithms Library
**(under development)**

Dynamic ridesharing is a type of vehicle routing problem (VRP) closely related
to the variants known as PDPTW (or VRPPDTW) and DARP (dial-a-ride). Consider
customers and vehicles appearing over time on a road network. The objective is
to route the vehicles to service the customers while minimizing total travel
distance.

Cargo: a C++11 library that aims to provide a set of abstractions for easily
developing and testing online ridesharing algorithms.

  simulation during the [Winter Simulation Conference '18](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/wsc2018/keynotes/)

Cargo's distinguishing features:
* Real-time (vehicles move in real-time; a simulation can take minutes,
  hours, as long as you like)
* Customers and vehicles are bound to road networks
* Easy interface for implementing ridesharing algorithms
* High performance -- can simulate 17,000 vehicles per second on a i5-6200 CPU @ 2.30 Ghz
  machine

Supports:
* Dynamically arriving vehicles and customers
* Vehicles with different capacities, customers with different loads
* Multiple depots
* Time windows on origins and destinations

Does not (currently) support:
* Variable-cost roads (traffic)
* Directed road networks (<-- probably supported but needs testing)
* Vehicles "waiting" at a stop (*possible* but needs some work)
* Service-time at stops (for later)

### Built-ins:
*(Documentation is upcoming)*
* Classes: Stop, Schedule, Route, Trip, Customer, Vehicle, etc.
* Functions: constraints checking, schedule insertion, schedule routing,
  shortest-paths, Haversine, etc.
* Abstract RSAlgorithm class (you must implement these methods):
  - `RSAlgorithm::handle_customer()`: called for every customer request
  - `RSAlgorithm::handle_vehicle()`: called whenever a new vehicle appears
  - `RSAlgorithm::match()`: called at some configurable frequency
  - `RSAlgorithm::end()`: called at the end of the simulation
  - `RSAlgorithm::listen()`: fine-tune an algorithm's polling (batch vs streaming)
    (default listen() is provided)

### Simulation platform:
* Simulation state is stored in an in-memory Sqlite3 database
* `Cargo::step()` runs every second to update locations of vehicles
* `RSAlgorithm::listen()` polls every second (configurable) for new vehicles/customers
* Three cleaned road networks are provided (`data/roadnetwork`)
* Several problem instances are provided (`data/benchmark`)

Provided road networks:

<img src="data/roadnetwork/fig/bj5.png" alt="Beijing, China" width="280"/>
</p>

### Options
* Time multiplier (run the simulation in 1x, 2x, etc. speed)
* Matching period (time before customer requests timeout)
* Vehicle speed (meters/second)

### Extra tools
* `tool/gtreebuilder` - build a GTree spatial index (Zhong 2015) for fast
  shortest-path finding
* `tool/probplot` - plot road networks and problem sets using matplotlib
* `tool/rspgen` - generate ridesharing problem instances
* `tool/rspoptsol` - solve problem instances using a mixed-integer
  mathematical program model to find their offline optimal solutions

### Example
This example implements a greedy-insertion matching strategy. The example
overrides handle_customer() in order to match each customer as it arrives.
Check the `example` folder for more.
```cpp
void GreedyInsertion::handle_customer(const cargo::Customer cust)
{
    /* Don't consider customers that are assigned but not yet picked up */
    if (cust.assigned())
        return;

    /* Containers for storing outputs */
    cargo::DistanceInt cost;
    cargo::DistanceInt best_cost = cargo::InfinityInt;
    std::vector<cargo::Stop> schedule, best_schedule;
    std::vector<cargo::Waypoint> route, best_route;

    /* best_vehicle will point to an underlying MutableVehicle in our grid */
    std::shared_ptr<cargo::MutableVehicle> best_vehicle;
    bool matched = false;

    /* Get candidates from the local grid index
     * (the grid is refreshed during listen()) */
    cargo::DistanceInt range = cargo::pickup_range(cust, cargo::Cargo::now());
    auto candidates = grid_.within_about(range, cust.origin());

    /* Loop through candidates and check which is the greedy match */
    for (const auto& cand : candidates) {

        // Don't consider vehicles that are already queued to capacity
        if (cand->queued() == cand->capacity())
            continue;

        cost = cargo::sop_insert(cand, cust, schedule, route);
        bool within_time = cargo::check_timewindow_constr(schedule, route);
        if ((cost < best_cost) && within_time) {
            best_cost = cost;
            best_schedule = schedule;
            best_route = route;
            best_vehicle = cand; // copy the pointer
            matched = true;
        }
    }

    /* Commit match to the db. Also refresh our local grid index, so data is
     * fresh for other handle_customers that occur before the next listen(). */
    if (matched) {
        grid_.commit(best_vehicle, best_route, best_schedule); // <-- update local
        commit(cust, *best_vehicle, best_route, best_schedule); // <-- write to the db TODO make commit accept pointer as 2nd arg
        print_success << "Match (cust" << cust.id() << ", veh" << best_vehicle->id() << ")\n";
        nmatches++;
    }
}
```

## Building and usage

### Building
So far, Cargo has only been tested on Linux. Build using
```
make
```
This command will output the static library file into `lib/libcargo.a`.

To use the library in your own project, copy `include/*` and `libcargo.a`
into someplace where your compiler can find. For example:
```
myproject/
  include/libcargo.a
  include/*
  myalgorithm.cc
```
Then, compile using `-Iinclude`  and link the library using `-Linclude -lcargo`.
Cargo depends on gtree, which depends on [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview). Cargo also uses pthreads.

Look at the Makefiles in the examples for guidance.

### Usage
Include the library, implement an algorithm using the base RSAlgorithm class,
then call `cargo.start(alg)`. Here is what myalgorithm.cc might look like:
```cpp
#include "libcargo.h"
#include "myalgorithm.h" // <-- MyAlgorithm should inherit from RSAlgorithm
MyAlgorithm::handle_customer() { /* Custom code here */ }
MyAlgorithm::handle_vehicle() { /*...*/ }
MyAlgorithm::match() {}
MyAlgorithm::listen() {}
MyAlgorithm::end() {}
int main()
{
    cargo::Options opt;
    opt.path_to_roadnet = "my.rnet";
    opt.path_to_gtree   = "my.gtree";
    opt.path_to_edges   = "my.edges";
    opt.path_to_problem = "some.instance";
    opt.time_multiplier = 1;  // 1=real-time, 2=double-time, etc.
    opt.vehicle_speed   = 10; // meters per second
    opt.matching_period = 60; // seconds

    MyAlgorithm alg;
    cargo::Cargo cargo(opt);
    cargo.start(alg); // <-- cargo takes care of starting up threads,
                      //     calling alg.listen(), etc.
}
```

## To do:
* Simulation statistics (number of matches, avg. trip delay, etc.)
* Plotting and animation
* Better problem instances, with matching models for rspoptsol
* Optimal solutions to the instances
* More examples
