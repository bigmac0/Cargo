# Cargo - Ridesharing Simulator Library
**(under development)**

Ridesharing is a type of vehicle routing problem (VRP).  Consider customers and
vehicles appearing over time on a road network. The objective is to route the
vehicles to service the customers while minimizing total travel distance.

Cargo is a C++11 library that provides tools for developing and evaluating
ridesharing algorithms through real-time simulation. Users can develop
algorithms by extending the `RSAlgorithm` class and evaluate their algorithms
on provided benchmarks. Each instance comprises a road network and a "problem"
file consisting of vehicles and customers on the network.

Users develop ridesharing algorithms by implementing five `RSAlgorithm`
virtual methods: `handle_vehicle`, `handle_customer`, `listen`, `match`, and
`end`.

See the docs (TODO) for more about the `RSAlgorithm` class.

In this example, an algorithm `MyAlgorithm` stores new vehicles in a local
index and matches customers as they arrive. The class extends `RSAlgorithm` and
imports a custom spatial index:
```cpp
#include "libcargo.h"
#include "myindex.h"
class MyAlgorithm : public RSAlgorithm {
 public:
  // ...
 private:
  MyIndex myidx;  // a custom spatial index
};
```

The algorithm adds each active vehicle to the index.  The method
`cargo::Vehicle::id()` returns the ID of a vehicle.
```cpp
MyAlgorithm::handle_vehicle(const cargo::Vehicle vehl) {
    my_index.add(vehl);
}
```

To keep the vehicles fresh, the algorithm clears the index each time new
vehicles and customers are polled:
```cpp
MyAlgorithm::listen() {
    my_index.clear();
    RSAlgorithm::listen();  // call the base listen()
}
```

The algorithm tries to match a customer to the nearest vehicle. Here, the index
returns a `MutableVehicle` in order to modify the vehicle's schedule with the
customer's stops. The method `cargo::Customer::orig()` returns a customer's
origin node. Types `Stop` and `Wayp` represent physical stops and waypoints.  A
sequence of waypoints represents a route through the road network. The function
`sop_insert` performs Jaw's insertion heuristic to insert the customer's stops
into the vehicle's schedule (`new_schedule` and `new_route` are the outputs).
The function `chktw` checks if the new schedule and route meet time window
constraints; finally `assign` attempts to commit the assignment to the
database. The flag `true` indicates to perform a "strict assign".
```
MyAlgorithm::handle_customer(const cargo::Customer cust) {
    MutableVehicle closest_vehl = my_index.find_nearest_to(cust.orig());
    std::vector<Stop> new_schedule;
    std::vector<Wayp> new_route;
    sop_insert(closest_vehl, cust, new_schedule, new_route);
    if (chktw(new_schedule, new_route) {
        assign({cust.id()}, {}, *closest_vehl, true);
    }
}
```

See the `examples` folder for complete examples. See the docs (TODO) for more
about the classes and functions.


## Building and usage

### Building
So far, Cargo has only been tested on Linux. Build using
```
make
```
This command will output the static library file into `lib/libcargo.a`.

To use the library in your own project, copy `include/*` and `libcargo.a`
into someplace where your compiler can find. For example:
```
myproject/
  include/libcargo.a
  include/*
  myalgorithm.cc
```
Then, compile using `-Iinclude`  and link the library using `-Linclude -lcargo`.
Cargo depends on gtree, which depends on [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview). Cargo also uses pthreads.

Look at the Makefiles in the examples for guidance.

### Usage
Include the library, implement an algorithm using the base RSAlgorithm class,
then call `cargo.start(alg)`. Here is what myalgorithm.cc might look like:
```cpp
#include "libcargo.h"
#include "myalgorithm.h" // <-- MyAlgorithm should inherit from RSAlgorithm
MyAlgorithm::handle_customer() { /* Custom code here */ }
MyAlgorithm::handle_vehicle() { /*...*/ }
MyAlgorithm::match() {}
MyAlgorithm::listen() {}
MyAlgorithm::end() {}
int main()
{
    cargo::Options opt;
    opt.path_to_roadnet = "my.rnet";
    opt.path_to_gtree   = "my.gtree";
    opt.path_to_edges   = "my.edges";
    opt.path_to_problem = "some.instance";
    opt.time_multiplier = 1;  // 1=real-time, 2=double-time, etc.
    opt.vehicle_speed   = 10; // meters per second
    opt.matching_period = 60; // seconds

    MyAlgorithm alg;
    cargo::Cargo cargo(opt);
    cargo.start(alg); // <-- cargo takes care of starting up threads,
                      //     calling alg.listen(), etc.
}
```

## Log file:

Log file is orgnized by several lines indicating events during runtime, which are in the formats shown below. `[var]` is a placeholder for a variable.

```
[T] R [VID] [NODEID] [NODEID] ...
[T] V [VID] [NODEID] [VID] [NODEID] ...
[T] P [CID] [CID] ...
[T] D [CID] [CID] ...
[T] T [CID] [CID] ...
```

[T] indicates the simulation time when the event happens.

[VID] indicates vehicle id.

[NODEID] indicates node id in the roadnetwork.

[CID] indicates customer id.

R means route update, followed by one vehicle id and several node ids, representing a new route from current position.

V means vehicle position update, followed by pairs of vehicle id and node id.

P means pick up customers, followed by customer ids which are picked up at [T] time.

D means drop off customers, followed by customer ids which are dropped off at [T] time.

T means customers timeout, followed by customer ids whose waiting time exceeds the matching period.

## To do:
* Simulation statistics (number of matches, avg. trip delay, etc.)
* Plotting and animation
* Better problem instances, with matching models for rspoptsol
* Optimal solutions to the instances
* More examples
